            <p>This is my first attempt at writing a blog for my portfolio site while also exploring the ability of bootstrap to create and manipulate a web page.  This hopefully satisfies not just my Week 9 assignment, but marks a starting point for regular blog posts and exploration of responsive templates.</p>
