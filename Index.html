    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article>
        <p>I am an award-winning producer, writer, and storyteller with a limitless passion for delivering content and messages to a wide array of audiences.   I use strategic project planning and a collaborative, employee-engaging process to create clear, consistent output.  From writing to producing, to managing contacts through a media relations focused approach, I have been honored with Cronkite, Telly, and Emmy awards for political, technological, and developing news coverage and supervision from an executive level.</p>
