        <h2><i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin"></i>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an award-winning producer, writer, and storyteller with a limitless passion for delivering content and messages to a wide array of audiences.   I use strategic project planning and a collaborative, employee-engaging process to create clear, consistent output.  From writing to producing, to managing contacts through a media relations focused approach, I have been honored with Cronkite, Telly, and Emmy awards for political, technological, and developing news coverage and supervision from an executive level.  I will add more to this soon</p>
        <br>
        <h2><i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin"></i>Project Focused</h2>
        <p>I am well-versed at using every available resource to engage diverse teams of employees across multiple departments in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.  I believe the workday is finished when the work is done, not when the clock strikes a certain hour.  I believe in developing communication and strategic project plans for a collaborative process that is both creative and motivational.
        </p>
